## CHAPTER FOUR: SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND IMPLEMENTATION

### 4.1 Project Structure

The AfyaLink platform follows a well-organized directory structure:

```
/afyalink/
├── web_app/
│   ├── app.py              # Main Flask application
│   ├── init_db.py          # Database initialization
│   ├── requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
│   ├── static/
│   │   ├── css/           # Stylesheets
│   │   ├── js/            # JavaScript files
│   │   ├── images/        # Image assets
│   │   └── icons/         # Icon assets

└── squashCSV/             # Data processing scripts
    └── data/              # Raw CSV data files
```

### 4.2 Backend Implementation

The backend is implemented using Flask, a lightweight Python web framework. Here's the core application structure:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, jsonify
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from flask_login import LoginManager, UserMixin

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///health_facilities.db'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
login_manager = LoginManager()

class User(UserMixin, db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password_hash = db.Column(db.String(128))
    
class Facility(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'health_facilities'
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    facility_name = db.Column(db.String(255), nullable=False)
    facility_type = db.Column(db.String(50))
    latitude = db.Column(db.Float)
    longitude = db.Column(db.Float)
    assigned_service = db.Column(db.String(255))
```

Key backend features include:

1. User Authentication:
   - Flask-Login for session management
   - Password hashing for security
   - Role-based access control

2. Database Management:
   - SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations
   - SQLite database for development
   - Automated data import from CSV files

### 4.3 Frontend Implementation

The frontend uses vanilla JavaScript with modern ES6+ features, focusing on performance and maintainability. Here's an example of the map implementation:

```javascript
// Initialize map and location service
const map = L.map('map').setView([-1.2921, 36.8219], 12);
L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
    attribution: ' OpenStreetMap contributors'
}).addTo(map);

// Initialize marker cluster group
const markerCluster = L.markerClusterGroup();
map.addLayer(markerCluster);

// Location tracking functionality
function toggleLocationTracking() {
    const button = document.querySelector('[title="Your Location"]');
    if (isTrackingLocation) {
        locationService.stopTracking();
        button.classList.remove('active');
    } else {
        locationService.startTracking();
        button.classList.add('active');
    }
    isTrackingLocation = !isTrackingLocation;
}
```

The frontend architecture includes:

1. Interactive Map Features:
   - Leaflet.js for map rendering
   - Marker clustering for performance
   - Real-time location tracking
   - Custom facility markers

2. User Interface Components:
   - Responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox
   - Custom form components
   - Dynamic facility cards
   - Search and filter functionality

### 4.4 Data Flow and Integration

The application follows a clear data flow pattern:

1. Data Loading:
```python
def load_facilities_from_csv():
    df = pd.read_csv('Health_Facilities.csv')
    for _, row in df.iterrows():
        facility = Facility(
            facility_name=row['Facility Name'],
            facility_type=row['Facility Type'],
            latitude=row['Latitude'],
            longitude=row['Longitude']
        )
        db.session.add(facility)
    db.session.commit()
```

2. API Endpoints:
```python
@app.route('/api/facilities')
def get_facilities():
    facilities = Facility.query.all()
    return jsonify([{
        'id': f.id,
        'name': f.facility_name,
        'type': f.facility_type,
        'lat': f.latitude,
        'lon': f.longitude,
        'services': f.assigned_service
    } for f in facilities])
```

3. Frontend Integration:
```javascript
async function fetchFacilities() {
    try {
        const response = await fetch('/api/facilities');
        const facilities = await response.json();
        displayFacilities(facilities);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching facilities:', error);
    }
}

function displayFacilities(facilities) {
    markerCluster.clearLayers();
    facilities.forEach(facility => {
        const marker = L.marker([facility.lat, facility.lon], {
            icon: facilityIcons[facility.type]
        });
        marker.bindPopup(createPopupContent(facility));
        markerCluster.addLayer(marker);
    });
}
```

### 4.5 Security Implementation

Security measures are implemented at multiple levels:

1. Authentication:
```python
@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def login():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        user = User.query.filter_by(username=request.form['username']).first()
        if user and user.check_password(request.form['password']):
            login_user(user)
            return redirect(url_for('dashboard'))
    return render_template('login.html')
```

2. Data Protection:
   - HTTPS enforcement
   - Password hashing
   - SQL injection prevention through SQLAlchemy
   - CSRF protection
